I'd like to become Junior JavaScript Developer. I've tried different schools to expand my knowledge.
Now I already know how to create page using HTML and CSS (my knowledge is enough to create simple web pages)
I've already learned Basics of HTML and CSS (Netology), I'm learning all basics on HTML-Academy and I'm joining *RS-School* now). 
I've already done two projects during my education in HTML-Academy. 
I also watch various educational videos on LinkedIn.
My English level was checked in December 2019. B1+. I continue to improve my English using BBC Learning Englsh. I also speak French a bit.
